# tool-pyLoopIT

This is a Python wrapper that simplifies interfacing with a LoopIT device. You can update parameters, start stimulation, and stop stimulation from within your own programs.

# Installation
Git clone this repository and then pip install. 
```
git clone https://github.com/ethanrich/tool-pyLoopIT.git
```

# Prerequisites
Running this program assumes that you have a LoopIT device or you have mocked one for development.

# Usage
Please see test.py.
In this file, you will see how certain values must be given to connect to the LoopIT. Then, you can send any command you want as a "parameter" and "value".
